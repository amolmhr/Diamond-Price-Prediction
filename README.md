## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/amolmhr/diamond-price-prediction.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd diamond-price-prediction
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage


1. Train the model:
    ```sh
    python training_pipeline.py
    ```
2. Make predictions:
    ```sh
    python prediction_pipeline.py
    ```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/shivam2503/diamonds). It contains the following features:
- Carat
- Cut
- Color
- Clarity
- Depth
- Table
- Price
- X (length)
- Y (width)
- Z (depth)

## Models

The following machine learning models are used in this project:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor

## Results

The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) score. The results are summarized in the `results` directory.
